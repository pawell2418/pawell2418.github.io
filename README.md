# [Pawell2418 Gallery](https://pawell2418.github.io)

Hello, this is my gallery. I also host my images at [Twitter](https://twitter.com/Pawell2418) and [DeviantArt](https://www.deviantart.com/pawell2418).

**<https://pawell2418.github.io/>**

Now you may ask **why would i make my own website?** The answer is simple: as my gallery keeps growing, it is more and more bothersome to quickly browse it. I am not aware of any modern website which allows hosting art and can show hundreds of thumbnails at once. So i made my own. **Why GitHub?** They offer 1 GB of storage, are easy to use, allow "nudity for artistic purposes and it seems they don't throttle bandwidth. And i can push new art with self-made script. Honestly show me better free web hosting i dare you.
