<h1>Frequently asked Questions</h1>
<p>Welcome to my personal website! I will use it (for now) as just another <b>place to upload my <i><a href="index.html?sort=rat&tags=~art">art</a></i></b>. I strongly believe every single website should have FAQ, no matter how small or insignificant it is: to quickly explain what is purpose of that place to save time and nerves of any visitors.</p>

<h2>Can you draw something for me?</h2>
<p><b>Sure</b>. But <b>i won't work for free</b>. Decide on your budget and send me a message to <a href="https://twitter.com/Pawell2418">twitter</a> or <a href="https://www.deviantart.com/pawell2418">DA</a>. I check them every time i finish drawing so expect a reply in a few days. Or if you are really impatient use <a href="https://discord.com">discord</a>. Time is money and very limited.</p>

<h2>Can you teach me how to draw?</h2>
<p>Yes and no. Mostly <b>yes</b>. But there isn't much i can do for you directly, only share some limited <b><a href="wisdom.html">WISDOM</a></b> with you. The rest is up to you.</p>

<h2>Why github.io?</h2>
<p>It is completely free, it comes with HTTPS, 1GB of space and it is lighting fast. The <b>conventional modern websites for artists are shit</b> in comparison to this. You don't need account, you can see hundreds of my pieces on 1 screen and filter them by tags. By the time twitter or DA will load first 10 thumbnails of my gallery on this website you can browse and see them ALL.</p> 
<p>I even made simple <a href="https://github.com/pawell2418/pawell2418.github.io">script and guide</a> so anyone can reuse my code and <b>set up their own gallery</b> like this in ~2 hours.</p>

<h2>Why are you drawing?</h2>
<p>My current "end goal" is <b>to make my own game</b>. No, i won't tell you what it will be about or how it will play like. First, i need to get good in drawing itself and that could take so long i might give up on the game in the end. And secondly, you could "steal" my idea and make it first :-)</p>

<p>Drawing is surprisingly <b>fun</b> and very complex activity. It enables me to listen to audio books and honestly, there is even a certain social status which comes with it. Since i started drawing it feels like i unlocked "3rd eye" or real vision: simply walking on street and observing the world around me and imagining how i would draw the scene is a nice bonus of it all.</p>

<h2>How long have you been drawing?</h2>
<p>I suffered through 5 years of "art classes" in <b>primary school</b>. We are talking about ages 5~10 years old me. I don't remember much from back then and the only art pieces i managed to find are <a href="index.html?dateto=2000-12-01">these</a>. I hated drawing back then. I distinctly remember always picking medium which was less messy and would allow me to cover the paper with color the fastest so i could stop claim i am done. So most of the time i used <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Crayon">crayons</a> unless teacher forced us to use specific medium.</p>
<p>After that i never considered art as topic even worth talking about, least even pursuing. I would occasionally read in news articles about ugly modern art being sold for X billions of money and that alone kept art in my mind as worthless. Never really been to any museum.</p>

<p>I decided to <b>plunge into drawing for real in the <a href="index.html?datefr=2022-01-01&dateto=2023-01-01">year 2022</a></b>! There was a slow buildup of me wanting to start working on the game. And nobody will play game without good art! I was always a nerd and computers never stopped fascinating me so of course i would jump into digital drawing from the start! Using paper in 21st century? That is too retro for me. So i bought my first tablet <a href="https://www.xp-pen.com/product/574.html">XP-Pen G960S</a> (i picked the cheapest tablet with large drawing area) and so i started.</p>

<h2>Why so many studies?</h2>
<p>Drawing is a painfully hard craft. Shortly after i started i realized <b>behind every successful artist there are hundreds, if not thousands of sketches and studies</b>. And practically all art books only confirm this. The only difference between me and average artist is that i save, sign and archive every single line, sketch and picture i make while they look at their failures and silently dispose of them.</p>
