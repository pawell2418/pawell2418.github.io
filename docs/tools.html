<h1>Tools of the Trade</h1>
<div class="tool">
	<div class="desc">
		<p>While it is true that you can paint by utilizing a wall of your cave as a canvas and mud combined with blood or ashes on your finger, it is undoubtedly simpler to use modern tools. Or even to make things a little bit smoother for yourself.</p>
		<p>As <a href="library.html?search=vilppu">Vilppu</a> once said: <b>"There are no rules, only tools."</b></p>
	</div>

<h2>Hardware: Accessories</h2>
<p>Make life easier for yourself.</p>
<div class="tool">

	</div>
	<div class="desc">
		<p>To <b>feel the form</b>. To bash your head with when things go wrong. To see <b>contour lines</b>. To see <b>perspective</b> rules with your own eyes. Deceptively simple yet very powerful for a beg. Build them yourself. Toilet paper roll for a cylinder, paper for a cube (9cm side will fit nicely into A3 paper). Make sure to properly bend the sides otherwise the cube will have "round" walls.</p>
	</div>
</div>
<div class="tool">
	<div class="desc">
		<p>For hardcore <b>figure drawing</b>. To properly learn how to <a href="p/328.jpg">draw people</a>, almost everybody recommends to learn how to simplify human figure into basic geometrical shapes like <a href="p/345.jpg">this</a>. These cheap, basic poseable wood manikin figures can make the learning easier. They are surprisingly cheap (i got mine for 11€ per figure), large and you can easily use them as home decoration once you no longer need them.</p>
		<p>Of course if you want to break a bank then go for the more expensive ones like <a href="https://solarisjapan.com/collections/figma">Figma Action Figures</a>, <a href="https://www.goodsmile.info/en/product/5650/figma+archetype+next+she+flesh+color+ver.html">Figma Archetype Next</a>, <a href="https://bodykundolls.com/products/drawing-figures">Bodykun Drawing Figures</a>, <a href="https://www.1000toys.jp/detail.aspx?goto=product1305">TOA Heavy Industries Synthetic Human</a>, <a href="https://armaturenine.com/products/smallbipeds">Armaturenine SMALL BIPEDS</a> or <a href="https://www.stickybones.com">magnetic Stickybones</a></p>

		<p>Keeps your hand <b>warm</b> during harsh cold winters, <b>reduces friction</b> between tablet and your hand and during hot summer <b>saps away sweat</b> which would otherwise hopelessly glue your hand to canvas.</p>
		<p>The only downside is that if anyone sees you using these, your social credit score will plummel down. Oh well, art demands sacrifices!</p>
	</div>

<div class="tool">
	<div class="desc">
		<p>There is this one classic <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Proverb">proverb</a>: Whatever isn't in the head is <strike>in the legs</strike> <b>on the sticky notes</b>. This mighty technology is found in literally every single corporate office. But do you have it in your home? I use it to write keyboard shortcuts in order to hopefully increase productivity over time. Is it working? No measurable results yet.</p>

		<a href="tool/pengrip.jpg"><img src="tool/pengrip.jpg" alt="Pen Grip"></a>
	</div>
	<div class="desc">
		<p>After a first few months i noticed my hand is gaining <b>permanent damage</b> to the nerves (dull ache while sleeping). To instantly solve that i got a <a href="https://www.amazon.com/pen-grip/s?k=pen+grip">pen gripper</a>. And in two weeks the pain in hand went away despite me kept drawing. This piece of rubber forces your hand to hold the pen under correct angle and as such it protects your own hand.</p>
		<p>Nowadays i dont use it since i learned how to draw more relaxed and how to adjust pressure curve in the drawing software so i dont have to push as much to get thick line.</p>
	</div>
</div>
<div class="tool">
	<div class="desc">
		<p>The more you draw the more "dull" the nibs in your stylus get. This makes it more awkward to draw. And it gets even worse: the dull nib typically produces very sharp edge which can strach your tablet (that actually happened to me!). </p>
		<p>With simple sandpaper or <b>nail file</b> you can give your nibs second life and make them smooth and tip round again!</p>

	</div>
	<div class="desc">
		<p>Put something perfectly round on the tablet. Trace it. If it won't produce perfect circle in your drawing app then you have a problem (usually solved by forcing aspect ratio between tablet:monitor). It took me 3 weeks before i noticed that my <b>tablet is skewing proportions</b> on the monitor.</p>
	</div>

<div class="clearleft"></div>
<h2>Hardware: Tablets</h2>
<p>There are thousands of tablets and brands on the market. <b>Don't ask me which is the best</b> because nobody can asnwer that question. Btw the only advantage of tablets with a screen offer is portability. If you buy iPad or similar tablet with a screen, you can easily draw digitally on the go. If you don't plan drawing outside of your art basement, then <b>screenless tablets</b> are the definitive way to go: cheaper, no overheating, no baterries, more precise, doesnt limit which drawing apps you use, maximum ergonomy. You can even <b>put paper on top of them to get real trad drawing feel</b>!</p>

	</div>
	<div class="desc">
		<p>My first tablet was <a href="https://www.xp-pen.com/product/star-g960s-star-g960s-plus.html">XP-Pen Star G960S</a>. It's drawing area was about A4 paper (ideal in my humble opinion). At the time i didn't really knew if i will even like drawing so i went for cheapest model which wasnt super tiny. Lasted me 6 months before i upgraded.</p>
		<p>The price was 40€ (i overpaid lmao) and it got the job done: i liked drawing and scratched it via my brute strength and ignorance.</p>
	</div>
</div>
<div class="tool">
	<div class="desc">
		<p>My <a href="p/169.jpg">second</a> and <b>current</b> tablet is <a href="https://www.xp-pen.com/product/deco-l-deco-lw-bluetooth.html">XP-Pen Deco L</a>. It is direct upgrade of the old one in every aspect.  Stylus is way more sensitive and has tilt detection. More buttons. Same drawing area.</p>
		<p>The price was 80€ (i overpaid AGAIN lmao). I can recommend this one to anyone. PRO or BEG, this will get the job done.</p>

<h2>Software: Drawing apps</h2>
<p>The main thing which makes the magic happen! This isnt complete list of all drawing apps. It is just my personal list of apps i (tried to) use for drawing. Sorted chronologically as i used / found them.</p>
<div class="tool">
	<div class="pic">
		<img src="tool/photofiltre.jpg" alt="Photofiltre Studio">
	</div>
	<div class="desc canceled">
		<p><a href="https://photofiltre-studio.com"><b>PhotoFiltre Studio</b></a>: Complete image retouching program. Now this is <b>RETRO</b>. I believe this was my first advanced app for editing images decades ago. Time flies fast i guess. <br>Dont try to use this in 2030.</p>

	</div>
	<div class="desc">
		<p><a href="https://www.gimp.org"><b>GIMP</b></a>: <b>GNU Image Manipulation Program</b>. I still use it as my go-to app for editing existing pictures. Compression for web, resizing, quick edits, pixel perfect sizing. The only reason why i used it at start was because i already knew the app prior to drawing.</p>

</div>
<div class="tool">

	</div>

		<p><a href="https://www.escapemotions.com/products/rebelle"><b>Rebelle</b></a>: <b>Phenomenal oils and watercolors</b> with traditional pigment color mixing. Amazing app which is as close to trad drawing as possible. It's only drawback is bad performance.
