<h1>Judgements</h1>
<p>Being a drawer involves receiving both praise and criticism. I've chosen some of the most excellent instances of both to share with you here. Sorted by time:</p>



<ul id="crits">
<!--
	png, max width 1024, max 256 colors, dont enlarge smaller, keep aspeect ratio
	<li class=YESlolBAD><a href="crit/9999999999999999999.png">AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA</a></li>
-->
	<li class=lol><a href="crit/20231025.png">>less thinking, more drawing >think less and draw more terrible mindset that will keep you permabeg forever pawell also when will you realise that <b>loomis is a hack</b> and start doing reilly instead?</a></li>
	<li class=lol><a href="crit/20231024.png">Aren't you actually planning to make a coom game or something? Why've you been doing gritty horror stuff? Also I miss your cute little space bunny guy wandering around 5 point perspective dreamworlds. Shit was cash. <b>Are you gonna make a horror porn game in 5 point perspective?</b></a></li>
	<li class=lol><a href="crit/20231023.png">Hello !! Please pardon my sudden approach, I must admit that you've got some exceptional artworks. I would loved to acquire some for my upcoming NFT collections of art. If you're interested then do well to hit me up. I'll be <b>willing to offer $13,000 each for these three pieces</b></a></li>
	<li class=lol><a href="crit/20231021.png">However, out of curiosity, why do you post in /beg/? I appreciate somebody better to give advice and critique, but <b>what do you gain from posting your work</b> here?</a></li>
	<li class=lol><a href="crit/20231020.png">is this guy falseflagging as pawell sucking his own dick to make people dislike him more?</a></li>
	<li class=bad><a href="crit/20231018.png">was about to post it but i dont want my work associted to beg anymore, especially when autists like p*well is roaming around and this abomination >>6892094 guess you just have to take my word for it</a></li>
	<li class=bad><a href="crit/20231016.png">Redpill on Pawell. <b>Is he fucking autistic?</b> He copies books and courses back to back but he doesn't do SHIT. I just saw him harrassing jap artists telling them that they need Loomis.</a></li>
	<li class=yes><a href="crit/20231014.png">Hey pawell, I just want to say I don't think you are a permabeg. Watching your progress has been great, you actually inspire me to keep going. <b>Let's go you majestic motherfucker</b></a></li>
	<li class=lol><a href="crit/20231012.png">Good day O,I must say you are a blessed artist ,as I am blown away and attracted to your works. There are a few that have seized my in-depth attention and would love to acquire them through purchase as Digital NFTs, are you willing to offer them in sales?</a></li>
	<li class=bad><a href="crit/20231011.png">can this permaprepeg post anything that is not floating basic shapes? This crab has been here for <b>years posting his "advice" and is still a prebeg</b>. Embarrasing</a></li>
	<li class=lol><a href="crit/20230928.png">I've been following your art for over a year now I like what I see. <b>Your autistic passion also kind of scares me</b></a></li>
	<li class=lol><a href="crit/20230926.png">I think it's time to draw something that has meaning to you. Try to apply what you've learned.</a></li>
	<li class=lol><a href="crit/20230913.png">You are my kind of guy. I think I might just stop playing games, and find something else to do with my life, when steam stops supporting 7.</a></li>
	<li class=yes><a href="crit/20230912a.png">Pawell, even for all his seemingly mid drawings, will become a pro sooner than you will graduate high school. That nigga working hard.</a></li>
	<li class=lol><a href="crit/20230912.png">How are you doing? So at what age did you started discovering your kinks/fantasies and for how long have you been on this site for?? What are your fetish and your limits are welcome too.</a></li>
	<li class=bad><a href="crit/20230910.png">Why are you giving advice you absolute begtard</a></li>
	<li class=yes><a href="crit/20230907.png">1. Your art has improved massively, holy shit well done. 2. Why is there a slowly growing amount of schizo shit on each image?</a></li>
	<li class=yes><a href="crit/20230906.png">Special thank you to Pawell: this project literally wouldn't have been possible without your designs, I've said it before and I'll say it again - <b>you are an extremely talented artist with a strong sense of artistic direction</b> (which has kept me on track throughout the document creation), and a very unique goya-esque style which I think has tremendous potential for future work. If I end up doing a project in the future that your style would suit, you'll be my first call.</a></li>
	<li class=bad><a href="crit/20230905.png">Kill yourself.</a></li>
	<li class=yes><a href="crit/20230904.png">Keep up the good work! <b>You are an inspiration</b> that I don't need a yearly subscription to draw well</a></li>
	<li class=bad><a href="crit/20230902.png">this is borderline chris-chan tier of stagnation. admittedly at a higher level of effort but effort is not the measure of art quality</a></li>
	<li class=bad><a href="crit/20230901.png">holy schizophrenia batman i knew you are deranged judging by your posts let alone by your art but your gallery is a glimpse in the mind of a crazy person. absolutely mental. you have transcended stagnation, left behind regression and entered another dimension of existence where aesthetics do not exist. it seems like you literally cannot or care not to distinguish between what looks good or what looks bad. you are like a flesh automaton, producing pictures with no soul inside to guide your art. <b>looking at your shit is like looking into the open eyes of a corpse.</b></a></li>
	<li class=bad><a href="crit/20230831.png">Im trying to draw like pawell so I'm <b>drawing badly on purpose</b> to counter my perfectionism</a></li>
	<li class=bad><a href="crit/20230823.png">Another perspective bookâ€¦at this point I hope you will soor end your life for the benefit of humanity.</a></li>
	<li class=yes><a href="crit/20230805.png">Sorry about asking so unprompted, btw. It's just that I love your work and I thought you'd be the guy to ask.</a></li>
	<li class=yes><a href="crit/20230615.png">Yo, the stuff you posted recently with the 4chan shit talkers was absolutely fire. Very glad to be your friend. Keep proving them wrong. I respect the hell out of you and your talent.</a></li>
	<li class=lol><a href="crit/20230614.png">earnest question for Pawell: why do you continue? Often your posts characterise both <b>your extensive studying and your unique compositions as unbearable chores</b> to be completed. I don't have any criticism about pursuing drawing as an end in itself, rather than some project-based goal, but you don't seem to enjoy it that much.
</a></li>
	<li class=lol><a href="crit/20230613.png">Hello, I will love to commend your good works and creativity, but that is not why I am messaging you. I am texting you because I will love to purchase your art works as a web? project logo for an NFT fashion collection. Let me know if they are for sale.</a></li>
	<li class=lol><a href="crit/20230312.png">Hello . Your art works are really beautiful and unique. I was immediately drawn to them. Your style evokes so many emotions. Are they <b>up for sale as NFTs?</b></a></li>
	<li class=yes><a href="crit/20230310.png">He got some nice progress through the Bargue drawing course. Will be interesting to watch how his work will change when he starts doing more originals.</a></li>
	<li class=yes><a href="crit/20230309.png">Talking about anime, Pawell being featured in the OP was great The reactions just shows that <b>he lives rent free on crabs and permabegs minds</b>. Keep it up Pawell, make them seethe</a></li>
	<li class=bad><a href="crit/20230307.png">so many others were so much better than Pawell's shitty drawings. Because clearly, <b>Pawell is the CEO of/beg/ and these retards seem to love him</b> for some reason. I mean his art sucks evidently but he at least has charisma and generally offers sound advice and commentary.</a></li>
	<li class=lol><a href="crit/20230103.png">do more originalsssssss</a></li>
	<li class=yes><a href="crit/20221130.png">nice to see all your art man</a></li>
	<li class=yes><a href="crit/20221123.png">hey you gave me crit on my watercolour painting and i respect your art grind, hows it going?</a></li>
	<li class=yes><a href="crit/20221120.png">I cheer for your success in life</a></li>
	<li class=lol><a href="crit/20221118.png">You drew me</a></li>
	<li class=yes><a href="crit/20221109.png">Hoii im Mason!! Im a friend of Nats and from the dead art server x3 I really loved your work tho!!!! Im just not active a lot bc i work lol but i admire your dedication to the craft&lt;3</a></li>
	<li class=yes><a href="crit/20221104.png">man I love your pawell it's got this raw energy to it</a></li>
	<li class=yes><a href="crit/20221018.png">Hi. made a comment under your Klaus Schwab picture on DA. I just added you as a friend on Discord. I hope you don't mind.</a></li>
	<li class=lol><a href="crit/20221010.png">Hey, I see youre doing a ton of studies, are you looking to join an art server at all? A lot of the members are also serious studiers and I think you could benefit from it</a></li>
	<li class=lol><a href="crit/20221001.png">I mean most people pick up art because they have an idea, they have an idea before they even learn anything You seems kinda backwards</a></li>
	<li class=lol><a href="crit/20220822.png">We're basic on opposite ends, you're starting out fresh, doing all one's supposed to do when beginning and setting a smooth road ahead of you, while I have years of blind drawing through a dogshit road and a lot of pent up pressure for not being as good as I wish I were. <b>When I lift up the pencil, I have to also lift up my shame and grandma's tears.</b> I also have many formed opinions/conceptions of what is/isn't right or what should/shouldn't be done with my art, while it seems you're just trusting the plan and will decide what to do once you've come out the other side, I'm trying to think like that when practicing but it's tough</a></li>
	<li class=yes><a href="crit/20220806.png">Thanks for always posting. I find your daily posts inspiring and it makes me want to practice.</a></li>
	<li class=bad><a href="crit/20220724.png">Sorry, this post was removed by Reddit's spam filters.</a></li>
	<li class=bad><a href="crit/20220717.png">Sorry, this post has been removed by moderators of r/learnart.</a></li>
