<h1>Judgements</h1>
<p>Being a drawer involves receiving both praise and criticism. I've chosen some of the most excellent instances of both to share with you here. Sorted by time:</p>



<ul id="crits">
<!--

	<li class=YESlolBAD><a href="crit/9999999999999999999.png">AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA</a></li>
-->
	<li class=bad><a href="crit/20240130.png">He practices drawing a lot but <b>does not put much thought in</b> the process. I am right. Pawell will be here for the next 5 years mass replying to people while produce the same level of work as in January 2024. He You are too stuborn and set in your way to change. I bet people here love it having a mid /beg/ mass replying stroking their ego daily.</a></li>
	<li class=yes><a href="crit/20240124.png">Honestly, looking at him is just inspirational. He's the <b>embodiment of the human spirit</b>. He keeps getting raped and mogged by art on every level everyday, and yet he keeps getting up on his feet and going back for more. He might die fighting art, but maybe his children will keep going and maybe one day a great artist will be born from Pawell's genes. Talentless jobbers always go at it the hardest, maybe as a reminder that we should also give our best. You shouldn't care what his endgoal is, you should be wondering why a retard can do what you can't.</a></li>
	<li class=bad><a href="crit/20240110.png">pawell fucking stop drawing btw, if you still suck this much after all this years long odyssey it means <b>you can't fucking do it</b>. just find another hobby holy fuck it's like watching someone trying to impregnate their beloved pet based on the concept of "love always wins" at this point I'm starting to think its all an epic ruse. are you for real bro? really fr?</a></li>
	<li class=bad><a href="crit/20240107.png">This is Pawell, he doesn't learn from mistakes. He just speedruns through art books while making half assed copies of drawings there</a></li>
	<li class=lol><a href="crit/20240106.png">you are treating drawing like an rpg, <b>you cant grind out xp and gain a new spell</b>, you have to have conscious effort in improvement.</a></li>
	<li class=yes><a href="crit/20240105.png">Oh so this is pawell?! Why do you guys make fun of this guy when he is already decent? Better than anything I've submitted here anyways</a></li>
	<li class=yes><a href="crit/20240104.png">SCHIZO KΙΝΟ</a></li>
	<li class=lol><a href="crit/20240103.png">>no pawell posts for last 3 days. uhhh permabeg sisters this is not looking so good. >spending time with your family and friends on the holidays. ngmi</a></li>
	<li class=lol><a href="crit/20231224.png">I will NOT draw fat old men in 2024. <b>"Fundies" like that are a meme</b>. im taking this stand too, I WILL draw what want to draw and pawell can stay drawing his 80 year old fat men in hunched poses</a></li>
	<li class=bad><a href="crit/20231222.png">You drew the contour lines of the sphere before the boxes. The spheres were meant as a general ghideline for the position of the boxes. This can be seen in the sypplemental demonstration in the accompanying course with the book. Watch a demo. Not even kidding. The book has free demos. You are fucking up your drawing. You are <b>blatantly misapplying the methodology for imagination slop figures</b>. This will go nowhere until you STOP RUSHING</a></li>
	<li class=bad><a href="crit/20231220.png">Pawell is missing the discernment to self-correct. You don't go through 10+ books and still draw like that if you're not fixing mistakes in your process. It's as if he does a copy, looks back at the reference and sees his mistakes, but then either can't comprehend what to change to get a better drawing next time, or is completely apathetic to arriving at something tasteful and moves on. It's bewildering to see someone who is programming-inclined, which requires problem solving, going through books seemingly thoughtlessly and with pure rote copying and from-memory attempts like it will solve anything.</a></li>
	<li class=yes><a href="crit/20231219.png">Pawell might be grinding his wheels stuck in mud rn but if he fovused on simple straight lines, curves, ovoids, cylinders and boxes for a month. His art would take him to high beg or int The way he constructed that bridge is kino</a></li>
	<li class=bad><a href="crit/20231218.png">First the first time I feel blackpilled. I looked at Pawells deviantart, how can someone draw so much, study such high quality sources and STILL look PREBEG</a></li>
	<li class=lol><a href="crit/20231217.png">it's a testament of his own ideology. he's a <b>right wing schizo</b> that rants about "globohomo" and feminism.. Every person's actions are filtered through their own ideology, his art is as ugly as his brain</a></li>
	<li class=lol><a href="crit/20231216.png">Greetings.. This is very interesting work, your works - I love that you captured the essence of modernity so elegantly! I've been looking at your work for a while now. I'm a big fan of modernity and contemporary art in general, It's very impressive! Indeed. You've beautiful and amazing art work there's no denying that. They are AMAZING!!. Are you also into NFT?</a></li>
	<li class=bad><a href="crit/20231211.png">No offense Pawell but some of these drawings are pretty <b>low quality even for doodles</b>. Look at pic related. What happened? Did FWAP break you?</a></li>
	<li class=yes><a href="crit/20231206.png">Hey, I'd pretty much given up on art for the last 6 months but <b>seeing you post every day got me back so thanks.</b> Also, when you're studying the loomis book do you copy the 2d shapes you see or do you recreate the 3d forms they represent, always thinking in 3d?</a></li>
	<li class=lol><a href="crit/20231205.png">Greetings, How are you doing? Where are you from? Hope you're aware of the <b>ongoing global currency reset?</b></a></li>
	<li class=bad><a href="crit/20231204.png">please drop fwap it's giving you <b>art dementia</b></a></li>
	<li class=yes><a href="crit/20231203.png">You're legit getting better Pawell Don't let the crabs get to you</a></li>
	<li class=bad><a href="crit/20231127.png">Just look at Pawell he can spend 10 more years studying loomis but he will still be a permabeg because <b>he has no talent for drawing.</b></a></li>
	<li class=bad><a href="crit/20231126.png">Get a job nigger. Pawell doesn't have a job, he lives on subsistence <b>doing shitty drawings as a copout for not moving forward in life. Sad!</b>. Also has pedophiles and scat fetishists on his dead server. pawell should focus on drawing porn make money off that i've seen furry artist post money spreads. Realistically that's such an oversaturated market He'd have to target specific shit I guess. he should wait until the great depression when every artist dies of starvation. he would make bank of making drawings of tracer getting mating pressed when theirs a need</a></li>
	<li class=bad><a href="crit/20231125.png">Is Pawell proof that talent is real? He is putting in both mileage and studying but he is still a permabeg.</a></li>
	<li class=lol><a href="crit/20231124.png">I noticed some intersting things in pawell's work. Look at the middle drawing. very accurate copy. he was probably <b>fascinated by the dominant masculine features of the man and imagined running his hands through them as he hatched the lines along the forms</b>. This is the story I get from the lines. On the drawing of the left you can see that he could not hide his deep contempt. He was repulsed by the feminine features, the dirty look on the face shows his disdain. I think he saw the man as a cockroach and wanted to kill him.. On the drawing of the right you can see he did not care at all, he just gave up. <b>The warped face of the bitch shows his view of the female look being absurd and ridiculous, I think he could not wait to finish it. He find absolutely nothing attractive about the female form.</b></a></li>
	<li class=yes><a href="crit/20231121.png">I just visited your blog out of curiosity and I must say your <b>"wisdom" part of your website is actually good advice.</b> Seeing your library made me a little bit scared. Did you read all those books?. Your constant studies are impressive, you never stop and actually draw which is something 50% of /beg/ don't even do.. Here is some critique though: Try to filter out useless parts and studies. I don't think copying these figures from the loomis beginner book helps you since you already copied so many other figures from other books. I think you should focus on the parts on which you feel the most insecure about.</a></li>
	<li class=bad><a href="crit/20231111.png">kill yourself pawell</a></li>
	<li class=lol><a href="crit/20231109.png">Dear, Pawell2418! Your art left a positive impression on our team. Kabam Games invites you to a new project.

	<li class=lol><a href="crit/231109b.png">>I'm getting filtered by Loomis. What do? >Stay your course and continue to collide against the dead end that is Loomeme, either by drawing those fugly heads or the 'stick' figures (personally, I feel the stick figures as a construction exercise are a more productive practice in general). >Spawn more pointless threads like this one. >Realize how much time you've lost and allow yourself to fall into a deep instrospective state where you question your true motives and goals. ><b>Get up from your chair, fix yourself some decent breakfast, read the Czechia times and have a small normie break from your schizo-"please activate windows"-assburgerism</b> for once. >Stop Looming for good this time. >Leave this waste of a site for good. >Profit?</a></li>
	<li class=lol><a href="crit/20231025.png">>less thinking, more drawing >think less and draw more terrible mindset that will keep you permabeg forever pawell also when will you realise that <b>loomis is a hack</b> and start doing reilly instead?</a></li>
	<li class=lol><a href="crit/20231024.png">Aren't you actually planning to make a coom game or something? Why've you been doing gritty horror stuff? Also I miss your cute little space bunny guy wandering around 5 point perspective dreamworlds. Shit was cash. <b>Are you gonna make a horror porn game in 5 point perspective?</b></a></li>
	<li class=lol><a href="crit/20231023.png">Hello !! Please pardon my sudden approach, I must admit that you've got some exceptional artworks. I would loved to acquire some for my upcoming NFT collections of art. If you're interested then do well to hit me up. I'll be <b>willing to offer $13,000 each for these three pieces</b></a></li>
	<li class=lol><a href="crit/20231021.png">However, out of curiosity, why do you post in /beg/? I appreciate somebody better to give advice and critique, but <b>what do you gain from posting your work</b> here?</a></li>
	<li class=lol><a href="crit/20231020.png">is this guy falseflagging as pawell sucking his own dick to make people dislike him more?</a></li>
	<li class=bad><a href="crit/20231018.png">was about to post it but i dont want my work associted to beg anymore, especially when autists like p*well is roaming around and this abomination >>6892094 guess you just have to take my word for it</a></li>
	<li class=bad><a href="crit/20231016.png">Redpill on Pawell. <b>Is he fucking autistic?</b> He copies books and courses back to back but he doesn't do SHIT. I just saw him harrassing jap artists telling them that they need Loomis.</a></li>
	<li class=yes><a href="crit/20231014.png">Hey pawell, I just want to say I don't think you are a permabeg. Watching your progress has been great, you actually inspire me to keep going. <b>Let's go you majestic motherfucker</b></a></li>
	<li class=lol><a href="crit/20231012.png">Good day O,I must say you are a blessed artist ,as I am blown away and attracted to your works. There are a few that have seized my in-depth attention and would love to acquire them through purchase as Digital NFTs, are you willing to offer them in sales?</a></li>
	<li class=bad><a href="crit/20231011.png">can this permaprepeg post anything that is not floating basic shapes? This crab has been here for <b>years posting his "advice" and is still a prebeg</b>. Embarrasing</a></li>
	<li class=lol><a href="crit/20230928.png">I've been following your art for over a year now I like what I see. <b>Your autistic passion also kind of scares me</b></a></li>
	<li class=lol><a href="crit/20230926.png">I think it's time to draw something that has meaning to you. Try to apply what you've learned.</a></li>
	<li class=lol><a href="crit/20230913.png">You are my kind of guy. I think I might just stop playing games, and find something else to do with my life, when steam stops supporting 7.</a></li>
	<li class=yes><a href="crit/20230912a.png">Pawell, even for all his seemingly mid drawings, will become a pro sooner than you will graduate high school. That nigga working hard.</a></li>
	<li class=lol><a href="crit/20230912.png">How are you doing? So at what age did you started discovering your kinks/fantasies and for how long have you been on this site for?? What are your fetish and your limits are welcome too.</a></li>
	<li class=bad><a href="crit/20230910.png">Why are you giving advice you absolute begtard</a></li>
	<li class=yes><a href="crit/20230907.png">1. Your art has improved massively, holy shit well done. 2. Why is there a slowly growing amount of schizo shit on each image?</a></li>
	<li class=yes><a href="crit/20230906.png">Special thank you to Pawell: this project literally wouldn't have been possible without your designs, I've said it before and I'll say it again - <b>you are an extremely talented artist with a strong sense of artistic direction</b> (which has kept me on track throughout the document creation), and a very unique goya-esque style which I think has tremendous potential for future work. If I end up doing a project in the future that your style would suit, you'll be my first call.</a></li>
	<li class=bad><a href="crit/20230905.png">Kill yourself.</a></li>
	<li class=yes><a href="crit/20230904.png">Keep up the good work! <b>You are an inspiration</b> that I don't need a yearly subscription to draw well</a></li>
	<li class=bad><a href="crit/20230902.png">this is borderline chris-chan tier of stagnation. admittedly at a higher level of effort but effort is not the measure of art quality</a></li>
	<li class=bad><a href="crit/20230901.png">holy schizophrenia batman i knew you are deranged judging by your posts let alone by your art but your gallery is a glimpse in the mind of a crazy person. absolutely mental. you have transcended stagnation, left behind regression and entered another dimension of existence where aesthetics do not exist. it seems like you literally cannot or care not to distinguish between what looks good or what looks bad. you are like a flesh automaton, producing pictures with no soul inside to guide your art. <b>looking at your shit is like looking into the open eyes of a corpse.</b></a></li>
	<li class=bad><a href="crit/20230831.png">Im trying to draw like pawell so I'm <b>drawing badly on purpose</b> to counter my perfectionism</a></li>
	<li class=bad><a href="crit/20230823.png">Another perspective book…at this point I hope you will soor end your life for the benefit of humanity.</a></li>
	<li class=yes><a href="crit/20230805.png">Sorry about asking so unprompted, btw. It's just that I love your work and I thought you'd be the guy to ask.</a></li>
	<li class=yes><a href="crit/20230615.png">Yo, the stuff you posted recently with the 4chan shit talkers was absolutely fire. Very glad to be your friend. Keep proving them wrong. I respect the hell out of you and your talent.</a></li>
	<li class=lol><a href="crit/20230614.png">earnest question for Pawell: why do you continue? Often your posts characterise both <b>your extensive studying and your unique compositions as unbearable chores</b> to be completed. I don't have any criticism about pursuing drawing as an end in itself, rather than some project-based goal, but you don't seem to enjoy it that much.</a></li>
	<li class=lol><a href="crit/20230613.png">Hello, I will love to commend your good works and creativity, but that is not why I am messaging you. I am texting you because I will love to purchase your art works as a web? project logo for an NFT fashion collection. Let me know if they are for sale.</a></li>
	<li class=lol><a href="crit/20230312.png">Hello . Your art works are really beautiful and unique. I was immediately drawn to them. Your style evokes so many emotions. Are they <b>up for sale as NFTs?</b></a></li>
	<li class=yes><a href="crit/20230310.png">He got some nice progress through the Bargue drawing course. Will be interesting to watch how his work will change when he starts doing more originals.</a></li>
	<li class=yes><a href="crit/20230309.png">Talking about anime, Pawell being featured in the OP was great The reactions just shows that <b>he lives rent free on crabs and permabegs minds</b>. Keep it up Pawell, make them seethe</a></li>
	<li class=bad><a href="crit/20230307.png">so many others were so much better than Pawell's shitty drawings. Because clearly, <b>Pawell is the CEO of/beg/ and these retards seem to love him</b> for some reason. I mean his art sucks evidently but he at least has charisma and generally offers sound advice and commentary.</a></li>
	<li class=lol><a href="crit/20230103.png">do more originalsssssss</a></li>
	<li class=yes><a href="crit/20221130.png">nice to see all your art man</a></li>
	<li class=yes><a href="crit/20221123.png">hey you gave me crit on my watercolour painting and i respect your art grind, hows it going?</a></li>
	<li class=yes><a href="crit/20221120.png">I cheer for your success in life</a></li>
	<li class=lol><a href="crit/20221118.png">You drew me</a></li>
	<li class=yes><a href="crit/20221109.png">Hoii im Mason!! Im a friend of Nats and from the dead art server x3 I really loved your work tho!!!! Im just not active a lot bc i work lol but i admire your dedication to the craft&lt;3</a></li>
	<li class=yes><a href="crit/20221104.png">man I love your pawell it's got this raw energy to it</a></li>
	<li class=yes><a href="crit/20221018.png">Hi. made a comment under your Klaus Schwab picture on DA. I just added you as a friend on Discord. I hope you don't mind.</a></li>
	<li class=lol><a href="crit/20221010.png">Hey, I see youre doing a ton of studies, are you looking to join an art server at all? A lot of the members are also serious studiers and I think you could benefit from it</a></li>
	<li class=lol><a href="crit/20221001.png">I mean most people pick up art because they have an idea, they have an idea before they even learn anything You seems kinda backwards</a></li>
	<li class=lol><a href="crit/20220822.png">We're basic on opposite ends, you're starting out fresh, doing all one's supposed to do when beginning and setting a smooth road ahead of you, while I have years of blind drawing through a dogshit road and a lot of pent up pressure for not being as good as I wish I were. <b>When I lift up the pencil, I have to also lift up my shame and grandma's tears.</b> I also have many formed opinions/conceptions of what is/isn't right or what should/shouldn't be done with my art, while it seems you're just trusting the plan and will decide what to do once you've come out the other side, I'm trying to think like that when practicing but it's tough</a></li>
	<li class=yes><a href="crit/20220806.png">Thanks for always posting. I find your daily posts inspiring and it makes me want to practice.</a></li>
	<li class=bad><a href="crit/20220724.png">Sorry, this post was removed by Reddit's spam filters.</a></li>
	<li class=bad><a href="crit/20220717.png">Sorry, this post has been removed by moderators of r/learnart.</a></li>
