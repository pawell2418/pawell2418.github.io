<h1>Judgements</h1>
<p>Being a drawer involves receiving both praise and criticism. I've chosen some of the most excellent instances of both to share with you here. Sorted by time:</p>

<ul id="crits">
	<li class=lol><a href="crit/20230912.png">How are you doing? So at what age did you started discovering your kinks/fantasies and for how long have you been on this site for?? What are your fetish and your limits are welcome too.</a></li>
	<li class=yes><a href="crit/20230907.png">1. Your art has improved massively, holy shit well done. 2. Why is there a slowly growing amount of schizo shit on each image?</a></li>
	<li class=yes><a href="crit/20230906.png">Special thank you to Pawell: this project literally wouldn't have been possible without your designs, I've said it before and I'll say it again - <b>you are an extremely talented artist with a strong sense of artistic direction</b> (which has kept me on track throughout the document creation), and a very unique goya-esque style which I think has tremendous potential for future work. If I end up doing a project in the future that your style would suit, you'll be my first call.</a></li>
	<li class=bad><a href="crit/20230905.png">Kill yourself.</a></li>
	<li class=yes><a href="crit/20230904.png">Keep up the good work! <b>You are an inspiration</b> that I don't need a yearly subscription to draw well</a></li>
	<li class=bad><a href="crit/20230902.png">this is borderline chris-chan tier of stagnation. admittedly at a higher level of effort but effort is not the measure of art quality</a></li>
	<li class=bad><a href="crit/20230901.png">holy schizophrenia batman i knew you are deranged judging by your posts let alone by your art but your gallery is a glimpse in the mind of a crazy person. absolutely mental. you have transcended stagnation, left behind regression and entered another dimension of existence where aesthetics do not exist. it seems like you literally cannot or care not to distinguish between what looks good or what looks bad. you are like a flesh automaton, producing pictures with no soul inside to guide your art. <b>looking at your shit is like looking into the open eyes of a corpse.</b></a></li>
	<li class=bad><a href="crit/20230831.png">Im trying to draw like pawell so I'm <b>drawing badly on purpose</b> to counter my perfectionism</a></li>
	<li class=yes><a href="crit/20230805.png">Sorry about asking so unprompted, btw. It's just that I love your work and I thought you'd be the guy to ask.</a></li>
	<li class=yes><a href="crit/20230615.png">Yo, the stuff you posted recently with the 4chan shit talkers was absolutely fire. Very glad to be your friend. Keep proving them wrong. I respect the hell out of you and your talent.</a></li>
	<li class=lol><a href="crit/20230614.png">earnest question for Pawell: why do you continue? Often your posts characterise both <b>your extensive studying and your unique compositions as unbearable chores</b> to be completed. I don't have any criticism about pursuing drawing as an end in itself, rather than some project-based goal, but you don't seem to enjoy it that much.
</a></li>
	<li class=lol><a href="crit/20230613.png">Hello, I will love to commend your good works and creativity, but that is not why I am messaging you. I am texting you because I will love to purchase your art works as a web? project logo for an NFT fashion collection. Let me know if they are for sale.</a></li>
	<li class=lol><a href="crit/20230312.png">Hello . Your art works are really beautiful and unique. I was immediately drawn to them. Your style evokes so many emotions. Are they <b>up for sale as NFTs?</b></a></li>
	<li class=bad><a href="crit/20230307.png">so many others were so much better than Pawell's shitty drawings. Because clearly, <b>Pawell is the CEO of/beg/ and these retards seem to love him</b> for some reason. I mean his art sucks evidently but he at least has charisma and generally offers sound advice and commentary.</a></li>
	<li class=lol><a href="crit/20230103.png">do more originalsssssss</a></li>
	<li class=yes><a href="crit/20221130.png">nice to see all your art man</a></li>
	<li class=yes><a href="crit/20221123.png">hey you gave me crit on my watercolour painting and i respect your art grind, hows it going?</a></li>
	<li class=yes><a href="crit/20221120.png">I cheer for your success in life</a></li>
	<li class=lol><a href="crit/20221118.png">You drew me</a></li>
	<li class=yes><a href="crit/20221109.png">Hoii im Mason!! Im a friend of Nats and from the dead art server x3 I really loved your work tho!!!! Im just not active a lot bc i work lol but i admire your dedication to the craft&lt;3</a></li>
	<li class=yes><a href="crit/20221104.png">man I love your pawell it's got this raw energy to it</a></li>
	<li class=yes><a href="crit/20221018.png">Hi. made a comment under your Klaus Schwab picture on DA. I just added you as a friend on Discord. I hope you don't mind.</a></li>
	<li class=lol><a href="crit/20221010.png">Hey, I see youre doing a ton of studies, are you looking to join an art server at all? A lot of the members are also serious studiers and I think you could benefit from it</a></li>
	<li class=lol><a href="crit/20221001.png">I mean most people pick up art because they have an idea, they have an idea before they even learn anything You seems kinda backwards</a></li>
	<li class=lol><a href="crit/20220822.png">We're basic on opposite ends, you're starting out fresh, doing all one's supposed to do when beginning and setting a smooth road ahead of you, while I have years of blind drawing through a dogshit road and a lot of pent up pressure for not being as good as I wish I were. <b>When I lift up the pencil, I have to also lift up my shame and grandma's tears.</b> I also have many formed opinions/conceptions of what is/isn't right or what should/shouldn't be done with my art, while it seems you're just trusting the plan and will decide what to do once you've come out the other side, I'm trying to think like that when practicing but it's tough</a></li>
	<li class=yes><a href="crit/20220806.png">Thanks for always posting. I find your daily posts inspiring and it makes me want to practice.</a></li>
	<li class=bad><a href="crit/20220724.png">Sorry, this post was removed by Reddit's spam filters.</a></li>
	<li class=bad><a href="crit/20220717.png">Sorry, this post has been removed by moderators of r/learnart.</a></li>
