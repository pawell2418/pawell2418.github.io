<h1>Judgements</h1>
<p>Being a drawer involves receiving both praise and criticism. I've chosen some of the most excellent instances of both to share with you here. Sorted by time:</p>



<ul id="crits">
<!--

	<li class=YESlolBAD><a href="crit/9999999999999999999.png">AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA</a></li>
-->
	<li class=bad><a href="crit/20240317.png">I finally understand why you are still permabeg, despite drawing for 2 years. You just half-ass everything. Look at your painting. It could look amazing had you taken your time and spent 20-30 hours working on it. Instead you just make careless quick work and it looks kinda okay-ish and you are satisfied. It runs through every your figure. You are <b>rushing through dozens art books, hoping you'll get better through sheer milage</b>, but it doesn't work like this. If all you do is quick and sloppy, that's all you'll learn to draw.</a></li>
	<li class=yes><a href="crit/20240316.png">hahaha it's like your art took a 1000% leap in improvement overnight. I dont' know why your Vilppu copies came out so shit, but this here looks great. Keep up whatever you're doing. Pawell has always been good at painting he just sucks at vilppu blobs.</a></li>
	<li class=lol><a href="crit/20240315.png">this Pawell1234 is the reason why I kept arguing on here over and over again that/beg/ should keep their """"fucking'""" hands off of Loomis and drawabox in the very beginning and first build an understanding of their own but noooo0000-</a></li>
	<li class=bad><a href="crit/20240314.png">His goal is to acquire a singular very specific technical skill, which makes up only small portion of artist's skill set and not even top artists bother to fully master it. It's autism, plain and simple. Pawell just wants to do studies and he has no idea what he wants to draw. I don't care, what he does next. But <b>other begs should be warned to not end up like him</b>. Direct your time and effort into actually making art you dreamt of drawing. Use references if you can't draw purely from imagination. Do not get trapped in eternal student mind set. Do not wait for when you are "allowed" to draw. Simple as.</a></li>
	<li class=bad><a href="crit/20240313.png">You have terminal case of unrealistic goals. You said you want to be able to draw figures without need for a reference aka from imagination. However, even pro mangakas and comic artists with decades of experience and tens of thousands of figures drawn still have to use references from time to time. All pro artists use photo references, 3d models, some even just photograph themselves as a reference. You are <b>going to spend years grinding your ungodly ugly figures and still won't achieve your goal</b>. You already studied like 20 art books, just move on to drawing finished work you actually want to draw. I know you won't, btw. The only reason I am writing this is to maybe save someone else reading this from falling down your path. You will keep drawing your surreal deformed humans and won't get closer to your unachievable goal. I just hope someone else will learn from your mistake.</a></li>
	<li class=bad><a href="crit/20240312.png">The ugliness of those figure is unreal. You kinda feel the flow + form(20% out of 100%), and that it. Learn to present those in an appealing way and pay some little attention to the proportions.</a></li>
	<li class=lol><a href="crit/20240311.png">Jesus fucking christ did you really need another thread just to cry about some other anon? Go fucking draw already. He's not complaining about Pawell he's using Pawell as "evidence" that Bridgman and Loomis are useless. <b>Pawell isn't the target, he's the weapon.</b></a></li>
	<li class=lol><a href="crit/20240310.png">honestly wish i could see your thoughts as you draw this, <b>what are you even trying? what is your goal?</b> and im not saying long term, what is your goal for this drawing session in particular. Powell has been doing this shit for AGES, Don't question it.</a></li>
	<li class=lol><a href="crit/20240309.png">But you need to fuck off with this kind of stuff - I might argue with you a lot when it comes to conspiracies, but I can demonstrate what's right in this example. If you can't see what I've drawn, that's on you. Not that you asked for it, but <b>I won't be giving any more critique after this.</b></a></li>
	<li class=yes><a href="crit/20240306.png">Pawell's art is just <b>normal beg stuff that everyone has to suffer through</b> in order to draw nice things. I would not even say he's making slow progress. People just aren't used to seeing someone put literally everything they do up online, so it seems like his progress is slower. Things would go faster for him, though, if he were to draw what he likes. I heard he wants to make video games, so he should really be making studies of video game artists every single day. Master copies of those guys would improve his work more than copying Loomis or Vilppu. Take the principles from Loomis, then apply it to what you want to draw</a></li>
	<li class=bad><a href="crit/20240305.png">how did pawell start a month before me, spend more time drawing than me and without taking breaks and still wind up not being able to see form. i unlocked that shit in the first 6 months as a 30+ boomer its not even hard</a></li>
	<li class=yes><a href="crit/20240304.png">i unironically love this guy's website. it's like outsider art. not gmi, he ALREADY made it.</a></li>
	<li class=bad><a href="crit/20240229.png">There's literally nothing wrong with any of them. I don't know much about this pawell guy but from the looks of it he's an <b>extremely literal minded grindfag that is completely incapable of seeing the forest for the trees</b>. He's not understanding the concepts and the abstract meaning because he is stuck hard in concrete thinking. I'm no great artist but I learned plenty from Loomis, Vilppu, Bridgman, Hogarth, and etc. just by skimming through and gleaning the concepts that they were trying to teach. Like Loomis, it was pretty easy to get that shaved ball + wedge = head and that I could modify the 3D form to build different shaped heads and stick whatever kind of facial features I wanted onto them constructed out of different 3D volumes. Or constructing the body in proportion in 3D, all I had to do was place rectangles in perspective, divide them into 8 sections, and draw the body parts in the correct places on the grid, and then after some practice and a lot of doodling mannequins I learned to eyeball the proportions. I never, EVER copied, I always created drawings of my own BASED OFF OF the CONCEPT that was being taught at the time. Construction is the most important fundamental, sorry not sorry desu fampai. Draw your boxes and cylinders and blobs and wireframes and get a sense of perspective ingrained into you on a subconscious level.</a></li>
	<li class=bad><a href="crit/20240228.png">Every study you post, there is <b>no improvement and instead just further descent into madness</b>. You were laid out a path to figure drawing, yet you refuse listen to anyone and do anything, but pointless copies of beg books like an autismo you are. >draw gestures and simpler figures to understand and memorize general proportions and landmarks of human body >then focus on features and anatomy >when you understand both, draw it all together Instead you are in this middle ground, where you can capture neither proportions nor features. All proportions are fucked, because you don't have visual library and all features are symbol drawn, because you don't really study them. For last months you haven't posted a single drawing that looks remotely human. Maybe you should follow on your own advice and go back to KTD and learn to study and draw what you see.</a></li>
	<li class=bad><a href="crit/20240227.png">my grandparents are <b>insanely orthodox muslims and even they are more in touch with reality than you</b>. stop posting</a></li>
	<li class=lol><a href="crit/20240224.png">Nah, the only difference between pawel and 90% of /ic/ is just that he draws and also posts every his study here like an autist. 90% of /ic/ either posts 1 or 2 of their best works or just doesn't post neither works nor studies at all kek.</a></li>
	<li class=lol><a href="crit/20240223.png">Pawell is like an ink blot test, and I don't just mean how his figures look. We see that which we hate about our own ability and habits in him which <b>causes a vague existential dread that people like to lash out at</b>. Don't get me wrong, I'm something of a beg myself and I like the fucker and haven't given up on him, but he is frustrating. Anyway here's something that's roughly around my skill level. Not what I'd show off to impress people, but not my worst.</a></li>
	<li class=bad><a href="crit/20240222.png">I keep yelling at him to change his process but he keeps insisting he needs to be able to draw humans perfectly from imagination before he is "allowed to draw" for real. He will literally <b>die of old age before he can even draw humans</b>. It's the definition of insanity. He is absolutely ineffective with his current way of studying because he never applies it and he also makes the most visually unpleasing studies I've seen. He has poisoned his own brain with this.</a></li>
	<li class=bad><a href="crit/20240221.png">can you not draw aesthetically? it's like your make your drawings <b>always so ugly and lumpy on purpose</b>. even in your previous post the feet you drew were the ugliest I've ever seen. and I don't mean technically I've seen way worse skill wise i mean aesthetically. you really are gross.</a></li>
	<li class=yes><a href="crit/20240220.png">He looks like to me like he draws everything but never sticks to anything to refine it. Just jumping around doing random studies. The faces looks disgusting and uncanny to me and bodies look deformed and colours make it even worse. His art could be <b>great visual for some off putting animation or game</b></a></li>
	<li class=bad><a href="crit/20240219.png">Why should I take advice from random people online? For all I know you might be retards, gays, alcoholics, blacks, nodraws, permabegs or crabs. Irl <b>Pawell is a downs syndrome retard locked away in a forgotten room somewhere but here he is king</b>, free to give advice to the next generation of permabegs.</a></li>
	<li class=bad><a href="crit/20240215.png">Your perspective studies were really good, I thought you were bordering on /int/ already, but <b>what the fuck are you doing now?</b> Your lumpy figures barely make any sense, are you drawing exclusively michelin men? For your own sake, invest time into watching/reading any course/book on figure drawing, like Proko, Eviston, Hampton, Vilppu and go step by step from gesture to different body features as they describe. Draw full body figures, not just asses. And you struggle with proportions, the guy on the bottom left looks like a sausage with tiny ass. Draw much simpler, but proportional figures, instead of wasting time on shading nonsensical lumps. And if you are drawing from imagination and not using reference, draw at the very least 100+ full body figures from reference to burn proportions and basic anatomy into your memory.</a></li>
	<li class=bad><a href="crit/20240214.png">hey pawell you turbo crab, <b>still deceiving begs with your shit advice huh?</b> god i am glad you havent killed yourself, nothing boosts my mood more than seeing your low life shizo existance haunting this shithole year after year</a></li>
	<li class=bad><a href="crit/20240213.png">Who is this pawell faggot you keep talking about? just seems to do pages and pages of quick studies from art instruction books, and barely any actual drawing applying anything he studies, so not much sinks in. He would be better off just drawing whatever he likes instead of grinding book after book, actual mileage is acquired from original pieces. At least he is somewhat consistent with the grind, but that alone won't suffice. Pawell <b>could be mentored by Kim Jung Gi, Zdislaw Beksinksi, Ilya Repin and Normal rockwell themselves and he still won't be able to find morsel of skill in his shit brain.</b> He is unteachable destined for breaking rocks</a></li>
	<li class=bad><a href="crit/20240212.png">Every time I see your nonsensical blob figures, it gives me a reminder that no matter how bad I am, at least I am not THAT permabeg level of bad. Thank you, pawell.</a></li>
	<li class=bad><a href="crit/20240210.png">>At least know it's him when he gives his advice. Imagine if he gave it without us knowing it's him. We might take his advice seriously then. why does everyone hate on pawell? Not everyone hates on Pawell, just the people with eyes</a></li>
	<li class=bad><a href="crit/20240130.png">He practices drawing a lot but <b>does not put much thought in</b> the process. I am right. Pawell will be here for the next 5 years mass replying to people while produce the same level of work as in January 2024. He You are too stuborn and set in your way to change. I bet people here love it having a mid /beg/ mass replying stroking their ego daily.</a></li>
	<li class=yes><a href="crit/20240124.png">Honestly, looking at him is just inspirational. He's the <b>embodiment of the human spirit</b>. He keeps getting raped and mogged by art on every level everyday, and yet he keeps getting up on his feet and going back for more. He might die fighting art, but maybe his children will keep going and maybe one day a great artist will be born from Pawell's genes. Talentless jobbers always go at it the hardest, maybe as a reminder that we should also give our best. You shouldn't care what his endgoal is, you should be wondering why a retard can do what you can't.</a></li>
	<li class=bad><a href="crit/20240110.png">pawell fucking stop drawing btw, if you still suck this much after all this years long odyssey it means <b>you can't fucking do it</b>. just find another hobby holy fuck it's like watching someone trying to impregnate their beloved pet based on the concept of "love always wins" at this point I'm starting to think its all an epic ruse. are you for real bro? really fr?</a></li>
	<li class=bad><a href="crit/20240107.png">This is Pawell, he doesn't learn from mistakes. He just speedruns through art books while making half assed copies of drawings there</a></li>
	<li class=lol><a href="crit/20240106.png">you are treating drawing like an rpg, <b>you cant grind out xp and gain a new spell</b>, you have to have conscious effort in improvement.</a></li>
	<li class=yes><a href="crit/20240105.png">Oh so this is pawell?! Why do you guys make fun of this guy when he is already decent? Better than anything I've submitted here anyways</a></li>
	<li class=yes><a href="crit/20240104.png">SCHIZO KΙΝΟ</a></li>
	<li class=lol><a href="crit/20240103.png">>no pawell posts for last 3 days. uhhh permabeg sisters this is not looking so good. >spending time with your family and friends on the holidays. ngmi</a></li>
	<li class=year>2023</li>
	<li class=lol><a href="crit/20231224.png">I will NOT draw fat old men in 2024. <b>"Fundies" like that are a meme</b>. im taking this stand too, I WILL draw what want to draw and pawell can stay drawing his 80 year old fat men in hunched poses</a></li>
	<li class=bad><a href="crit/20231222.png">You drew the contour lines of the sphere before the boxes. The spheres were meant as a general ghideline for the position of the boxes. This can be seen in the sypplemental demonstration in the accompanying course with the book. Watch a demo. Not even kidding. The book has free demos. You are fucking up your drawing. You are <b>blatantly misapplying the methodology for imagination slop figures</b>. This will go nowhere until you STOP RUSHING</a></li>
	<li class=bad><a href="crit/20231220.png">Pawell is missing the discernment to self-correct. You don't go through 10+ books and still draw like that if you're not fixing mistakes in your process. It's as if he does a copy, looks back at the reference and sees his mistakes, but then either can't comprehend what to change to get a better drawing next time, or is completely apathetic to arriving at something tasteful and moves on. It's bewildering to see someone who is programming-inclined, which requires problem solving, going through books seemingly thoughtlessly and with pure rote copying and from-memory attempts like it will solve anything.</a></li>
	<li class=yes><a href="crit/20231219.png">Pawell might be grinding his wheels stuck in mud rn but if he fovused on simple straight lines, curves, ovoids, cylinders and boxes for a month. His art would take him to high beg or int The way he constructed that bridge is kino</a></li>
	<li class=bad><a href="crit/20231218.png">First the first time I feel blackpilled. I looked at Pawells deviantart, how can someone draw so much, study such high quality sources and STILL look PREBEG</a></li>
	<li class=lol><a href="crit/20231217.png">it's a testament of his own ideology. he's a <b>right wing schizo</b> that rants about "globohomo" and feminism.. Every person's actions are filtered through their own ideology, his art is as ugly as his brain</a></li>
	<li class=lol><a href="crit/20231216.png">Greetings.. This is very interesting work, your works - I love that you captured the essence of modernity so elegantly! I've been looking at your work for a while now. I'm a big fan of modernity and contemporary art in general, It's very impressive! Indeed. You've beautiful and amazing art work there's no denying that. They are AMAZING!!. Are you also into NFT?</a></li>
	<li class=bad><a href="crit/20231211.png">No offense Pawell but some of these drawings are pretty <b>low quality even for doodles</b>. Look at pic related. What happened? Did FWAP break you?</a></li>
	<li class=yes><a href="crit/20231206.png">Hey, I'd pretty much given up on art for the last 6 months but <b>seeing you post every day got me back so thanks.</b> Also, when you're studying the loomis book do you copy the 2d shapes you see or do you recreate the 3d forms they represent, always thinking in 3d?</a></li>
	<li class=lol><a href="crit/20231205.png">Greetings, How are you doing? Where are you from? Hope you're aware of the <b>ongoing global currency reset?</b></a></li>
	<li class=bad><a href="crit/20231204.png">please drop fwap it's giving you <b>art dementia</b></a></li>
	<li class=yes><a href="crit/20231203.png">You're legit getting better Pawell Don't let the crabs get to you</a></li>
	<li class=bad><a href="crit/20231127.png">Just look at Pawell he can spend 10 more years studying loomis but he will still be a permabeg because <b>he has no talent for drawing.</b></a></li>
	<li class=bad><a href="crit/20231126.png">Get a job nigger. Pawell doesn't have a job, he lives on subsistence <b>doing shitty drawings as a copout for not moving forward in life. Sad!</b>. Also has pedophiles and scat fetishists on his dead server. pawell should focus on drawing porn make money off that i've seen furry artist post money spreads. Realistically that's such an oversaturated market He'd have to target specific shit I guess. he should wait until the great depression when every artist dies of starvation. he would make bank of making drawings of tracer getting mating pressed when theirs a need</a></li>
	<li class=bad><a href="crit/20231125.png">Is Pawell proof that talent is real? He is putting in both mileage and studying but he is still a permabeg.</a></li>
	<li class=lol><a href="crit/20231124.png">I noticed some intersting things in pawell's work. Look at the middle drawing. very accurate copy. he was probably <b>fascinated by the dominant masculine features of the man and imagined running his hands through them as he hatched the lines along the forms</b>. This is the story I get from the lines. On the drawing of the left you can see that he could not hide his deep contempt. He was repulsed by the feminine features, the dirty look on the face shows his disdain. I think he saw the man as a cockroach and wanted to kill him.. On the drawing of the right you can see he did not care at all, he just gave up. <b>The warped face of the bitch shows his view of the female look being absurd and ridiculous, I think he could not wait to finish it. He find absolutely nothing attractive about the female form.</b></a></li>
	<li class=yes><a href="crit/20231121.png">I just visited your blog out of curiosity and I must say your <b>"wisdom" part of your website is actually good advice.</b> Seeing your library made me a little bit scared. Did you read all those books?. Your constant studies are impressive, you never stop and actually draw which is something 50% of /beg/ don't even do.. Here is some critique though: Try to filter out useless parts and studies. I don't think copying these figures from the loomis beginner book helps you since you already copied so many other figures from other books. I think you should focus on the parts on which you feel the most insecure about.</a></li>
	<li class=bad><a href="crit/20231111.png">kill yourself pawell</a></li>

	<li class=bad><a href="crit/20231016.png">Redpill on Pawell. <b>Is he fucking autistic?</b> He copies books and courses back to back but he doesn't do SHIT. I just saw him harrassing jap artists telling them that they need Loomis.</a></li>
	<li class=yes><a href="crit/20231014.png">Hey pawell, I just want to say I don't think you are a permabeg. Watching your progress has been great, you actually inspire me to keep going. <b>Let's go you majestic motherfucker</b></a></li>

	<li class=yes><a href="crit/20230907.png">1. Your art has improved massively, holy shit well done. 2. Why is there a slowly growing amount of schizo shit on each image?</a></li>
	<li class=yes><a href="crit/20230906.png">Special thank you to Pawell: this project literally wouldn't have been possible without your designs, I've said it before and I'll say it again - <b>you are an extremely talented artist with a strong sense of artistic direction</b> (which has kept me on track throughout the document creation), and a very unique goya-esque style which I think has tremendous potential for future work. If I end up doing a project in the future that your style would suit, you'll be my first call.</a></li>
	<li class=bad><a href="crit/20230905.png">Kill yourself.</a></li>
	<li class=yes><a href="crit/20230904.png">Keep up the good work! <b>You are an inspiration</b> that I don't need a yearly subscription to draw well</a></li>
	<li class=bad><a href="crit/20230902.png">this is borderline chris-chan tier of stagnation. admittedly at a higher level of effort but effort is not the measure of art quality</a></li>
	<li class=bad><a href="crit/20230901.png">holy schizophrenia batman i knew you are deranged judging by your posts let alone by your art but your gallery is a glimpse in the mind of a crazy person. absolutely mental. you have transcended stagnation, left behind regression and entered another dimension of existence where aesthetics do not exist. it seems like you literally cannot or care not to distinguish between what looks good or what looks bad. you are like a flesh automaton, producing pictures with no soul inside to guide your art. <b>looking at your shit is like looking into the open eyes of a corpse.</b></a></li>
	<li class=bad><a href="crit/20230831.png">Im trying to draw like pawell so I'm <b>drawing badly on purpose</b> to counter my perfectionism</a></li>
	<li class=bad><a href="crit/20230823.png">Another perspective book…at this point I hope you will soor end your life for the benefit of humanity.</a></li>
	<li class=yes><a href="crit/20230805.png">Sorry about asking so unprompted, btw. It's just that I love your work and I thought you'd be the guy to ask.</a></li>
	<li class=yes><a href="crit/20230615.png">Yo, the stuff you posted recently with the 4chan shit talkers was absolutely fire. Very glad to be your friend. Keep proving them wrong. I respect the hell out of you and your talent.</a></li>
	<li class=lol><a href="crit/20230614.png">earnest question for Pawell: why do you continue? Often your posts characterise both <b>your extensive studying and your unique compositions as unbearable chores</b> to be completed. I don't have any criticism about pursuing drawing as an end in itself, rather than some project-based goal, but you don't seem to enjoy it that much.</a></li>
	<li class=lol><a href="crit/20230613.png">Hello, I will love to commend your good works and creativity, but that is not why I am messaging you. I am texting you because I will love to purchase your art works as a web? project logo for an NFT fashion collection. Let me know if they are for sale.</a></li>
	<li class=lol><a href="crit/20230312.png">Hello . Your art works are really beautiful and unique. I was immediately drawn to them. Your style evokes so many emotions. Are they <b>up for sale as NFTs?</b></a></li>
	<li class=yes><a href="crit/20230310.png">He got some nice progress through the Bargue drawing course. Will be interesting to watch how his work will change when he starts doing more originals.</a></li>
	<li class=yes><a href="crit/20230309.png">Talking about anime, Pawell being featured in the OP was great The reactions just shows that <b>he lives rent free on crabs and permabegs minds</b>. Keep it up Pawell, make them seethe</a></li>
	<li class=bad><a href="crit/20230307.png">so many others were so much better than Pawell's shitty drawings. Because clearly, <b>Pawell is the CEO of/beg/ and these retards seem to love him</b> for some reason. I mean his art sucks evidently but he at least has charisma and generally offers sound advice and commentary.</a></li>
	<li class=lol><a href="crit/20230103.png">do more originalsssssss</a></li>
	<li class=year>2022</li>
	<li class=yes><a href="crit/20221130.png">nice to see all your art man</a></li>
	<li class=yes><a href="crit/20221123.png">hey you gave me crit on my watercolour painting and i respect your art grind, hows it going?</a></li>

	<li class=lol><a href="crit/20221118.png">You drew me</a></li>
	<li class=yes><a href="crit/20221109.png">Hoii im Mason!! Im a friend of Nats and from the dead art server x3 I really loved your work tho!!!! Im just not active a lot bc i work lol but i admire your dedication to the craft&lt;3</a></li>
	<li class=yes><a href="crit/20221104.png">man I love your pawell it's got this raw energy to it</a></li>
	<li class=yes><a href="crit/20221018.png">Hi. made a comment under your Klaus Schwab picture on DA. I just added you as a friend on Discord. I hope you don't mind.</a></li>
	<li class=lol><a href="crit/20221010.png">Hey, I see youre doing a ton of studies, are you looking to join an art server at all? A lot of the members are also serious studiers and I think you could benefit from it</a></li>
	<li class=lol><a href="crit/20221001.png">I mean most people pick up art because they have an idea, they have an idea before they even learn anything You seems kinda backwards</a></li>
	<li class=lol><a href="crit/20220822.png">We're basic on opposite ends, you're starting out fresh, doing all one's supposed to do when beginning and setting a smooth road ahead of you, while I have years of blind drawing through a dogshit road and a lot of pent up pressure for not being as good as I wish I were. <b>When I lift up the pencil, I have to also lift up my shame and grandma's tears.</b> I also have many formed opinions/conceptions of what is/isn't right or what should/shouldn't be done with my art, while it seems you're just trusting the plan and will decide what to do once you've come out the other side, I'm trying to think like that when practicing but it's tough</a></li>
	<li class=yes><a href="crit/20220806.png">Thanks for always posting. I find your daily posts inspiring and it makes me want to practice.</a></li>
