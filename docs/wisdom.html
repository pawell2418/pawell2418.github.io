<h1>How to draw</h1>
<p>When i started drawing first i searched internet for guidance. Naturally i found many places, websites, schools, courses and books on the subject. But unlike any other topic i was ever interested in, only in this craft have i seen so many (seemingly) <b>contradicting advice</b>:</p>
<div class="left">
	<img src="book/confused.jpg" title="confused man" width="230" height="300">
</div>
<div class="left">
	<ul>
		<li>Draw <a href="https://drawabox.com/">boxes</a>! Draw circles! Draw rocks!</li>
		<li>Don't bother; <a href="https://lexica.art">ai</a> will do it for you.</li>
		<li>Draw from real life!</li>
		<li>Enroll into a private <a href="https://www.nma.art">Art Academy</a>!</li>
		<li><a href="book/art_school_doesnt_teach_you_drawing.png">Schools don't teach you how to draw!</a></li>
		<li>Make <a href="https://www.nationalgallery.org.uk/research/research-resources/">master studies</a>!</li>
		<li>Anatomy! Perspective! Color theory!</li>
		<li>Start with paper and pencil!</li>
		<li>Buy <a href="https://www.clipstudio.net">CSP</a>! Buy <a href="https://www.wacom.com/">Wacom</a>! Buy <a href="https://www.proko.com">proko course</a>!</li>
		<li>If you had any talent, you would already be good!</li>
		<li>Dont copy, only draw from imagination!</li>
		<li>Just copy your favorite porn artist.</li>
		<li>Just doodle and have fun!</li>
		<li>Only gesture is essential!</li>
		<li>It is all about having Asian genes!</li>

</div>
<p class="clearleft">And i, as beginner with no experience, had to decide who was telling the truth and who was just a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Crab_mentality" title="Crab Mentality">crab</a> or an uninformed internet expert. So i made a <b>list of books and decided to go through them one by one</b>. Surely at least one of them contains the exercises or knowledge needed to get good!</p>

<h2>TLDR</h2>
<ul>
	<li><strong>OBSERVATION is the most important fundamental skill you have to master first!</strong></li>
	<li>You get good only by drawing A LOT. Make drawing a daily habit!</li>
	<li>Shy away from drawing purely from imagination at the start; ALWAYS use references!</li>
	<li>Pick ONE course or book and FINISH it. Don't switch them without a good reason!</li>
	<li>Find an art community where people aren't afraid to give you negative feedback.</li>
	<li>Broadcasted radio is good background music for drawing.</li>
	<li>Learning from great teachers might be easier and faster than from great artists.</li>
</ul>
<p>I could have written way more, cite my favorite book or artist, but honestly, for every advice, you will be able to find counter-advice from a successful or well-acclaimed artists who will claim the direct opposite. Observation and drawing a lot. That is all there is to it. Everything else is just a bonus that can hinder or speed up your progress.</p>
<p>Bellow is the list of books i completed. They are <b>sorted chronologically</b> as i went through them. I have read each book from start to finish, and you can easily tell if i did all the exercises + copied the drawings or if i just flew through it simply by checking the gallery.</p>

<h2>The <a href="library.html?tags=~beg">BEG books</a></h2>
<p>How to draw accurately what you see. Many beginners underestimate the importance of good observation skills. Dont be one of them. Without good eye you will never evolve as an artist or illustrator. These books are the stepping stone, the foundation upon you will build your art career no matter which subject, medium or style you choose.</p>

			<li><strong>9/10 easily the best book for beginner</strong>. The only drawback is a somewhat steep learning curve at the start. The book covers a broad range of drawing techniques while maintaining a steady skill curve. You will mostly draw from real life or references and learn about various drawing concepts like perspective, sighting, composition, rendering, shadows or even from where you can gain inspiration. This book's <b>power level is very high and scope very broad</b>. Dont underestimate it!</li>

			<li><strong>5/10 controversial experience imitating university art course</strong>. The book explicitly states you won't learn anything from it unless you follow through with the prescribed exercises and grind. I kid you not i improved just by the gesture grind. Around ~3000th gesture, it finally dawned on me. However, i cannot recommend this book to anyone unless they struggle with STIFF figures. Whatever this book teaches, it feels like you are doing it in the most inefficient way possible. But that could simply be just me. Anatomy, figure proportions, drapery, <b>feeling the form</b>. The book contains a lot of very interesting revelations. But the price you will pay will be MANY days of grinding gestures.</li>

			<li><strong>7/10 short, detailed, technical introduction to construction</strong> and the human figure. This book is VERY different from the others. It's as if you gave a mechanical engineer a task to produce a course on drawing. Instead of approaching the subject through observation, you are encouraged to use what you <b>know (form, shape)</b> about it. The book is very technical; it explains every single detail, from how to hold your pencil to how to make strokes. You start with drawing spheres and cubes, continue with fruits, and end up with a human figure. Very well written. Ideal for people who like geometry and hate unclear instructions.</li>

			<li><strong>3/10 catalogue of Neoclassicism</strong>.

The course is designed to be <b>utilized in an atelier under the supervision of a tutor</b>. The stunning images of ancient Roman sculptures are the only thing I liked. The book is written in the style of a diploma project: excellent for earning a university degree, terrible as a source of knowledge to learn from. It begins by spitting out highly condensed theory and a few helpful suggestions before unleashing an endless stream of references. The skill curve is extremely erratic. This book is useless unless you're interested in history tidbits like why women were forbidden in posing for figure studies.</li>

<h2>The <a href="library.html?tags=~persp">Perspective books</a></h2>
<p>It is impossible to draw accurately without knowing basic physical laws which dictate how objects look like depending on the distance or angle we observe them. And while many beg books covered the principles briefly, only going deep into this topic shall lead into successful illustrations of reality.

It explains the strict perspective rules in a very informal, lighthearted manner using numerous visual examples. Although it <b>doesnt explain 3P</b> perspective, it provides you with a number of effective geometrical techniques to address typical drawing problems. You can read this book cover to cover in one sitting, and if you don't forget the guidelines it gives you, all of your subsequent drawings will be more accurate.</li>

			<li><strong>5/10 designing step by step workbook</strong>. This book, despite its name, is <b>only intended for experienced artists who are already proficient in perspective</b>. It doesn't waste time discussing the obvious, so don't try to read this as your first perspective course. Traditional materials, drawing techniques, a fast review of perspective, and the use of simple geometrical techniques to accurately depict 3D forms in 2P perspective will all be introduced to you very rapidly. The book <b>demonstrates highly useful workflow used by veteran designers</b> when working with vehicles, planes, and landscapes to create stunning artwork. Additionally, it encourages you to experiment with <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SketchUp">3D digital tools</a> to improve accuracy or just to generate perspective grids.
			<br><br>
			At points, the book is very difficult to read, and some of the illustrations are almost invisible. But if you persevere, it will equip you with every trick you'll ever need to draw precise mechanical objects from references or your own unique personal concepts. There are no human figures to be found in this book.</li>

<h2>The <a href="library.html?tags=~figure">Figure books</a></h2>
<p><b>You should now be able to precisely sketch ANYTHING from a reference and even accurately modify it to meet the perspective</b> needed for your composition using both theoretical knowledge and practical skills.</p>
<p>Now is the time to begin learning how to sketch the most prevalent and challenging subject: the human figure. Ideally from memory to ensure that you are never constrained by your ability to locate reliable references! Why is it the most difficult subject to depict? Because any small error you make will be instantly obvious even to those without formal art training.</p>

			<li><strong>2/10 poor introduction to construction of human figure and head</strong>. Although Loomis is regarded as one of the most well-known American illustrators, and his books are highly recommended for both novice and experienced illustrators, this debut book should be avoided. His cartoon faces and figures frequently leave much to be desired in terms of aesthetics and educational value, and the skill curve is extremely steep. At first it presents a <b>simplified head model, then breaks the rules with examples right away. This is really annoying</b> because the book instructs you to build the heads using the blueprint it just provided rather than copying them. However, since every example violates the rules, you won't be able to duplicate the designs.
			<br><br>
			The book wasn't a total waste of time: it successfully forced me to stop relying on references and start sketching one of the most difficult art subjects from memory / imagination. However, it did it in a VERY nasty way. There has to be a better way.</li>
