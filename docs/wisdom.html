<h1>How to draw</h1>
<p>When i started drawing first i searched internet for guidance. Naturally i found many places, websites, schools, courses and books on the subject. But unlike any other topic i was ever interested in, only in this craft have i seen so many (seemingly) <b>contradicting advice</b>:</p>
<div class="left">
	<img src="book/confused.jpg" title="confused man" width="230" height="300">
</div>
<div class="left">
	<ul>
		<li>Draw boxes! Draw circles! Draw rocks!</li>
		<li>Don't bother; ai will do it for you.</li>
		<li>Draw from real life!</li>
		<li>Enroll into a private Art Academy!</li>
		<li>Schools don't teach you how to draw.</li>
		<li>Make master studies!</li>
		<li>Anatomy! Perspective! Color theory!</li>
		<li>Start with paper and pencil!</li>
		<li>Buy CSP! Buy Wacom! Buy proko course!</li>
		<li>If you had any talent, you would already be good!</li>
		<li>Dont copy, only draw from imagination!</li>
		<li>Just copy your favorite porn artist.</li>
		<li>Just doodle and have fun!</li>
		<li>Only gesture is essential!</li>
		<li>It is all about having Asian genes!</li>
		<li>Loomis! Hampton! Bridgman! Villpu!</li>
	</ul>
</div>
<p class="clearleft">And i, as beginner with no experience, had to decide who was telling the truth and who was just a crab or an uninformed internet expert. So i made a <b>list of books and decided to go through them one by one</b>. Surely at least one of them contains the exercises or knowledge needed to get good!</p>

<h2>TLDR</h2>
<ul>
	<li><strong>OBSERVATION is the most important fundamental skill you have to master first!</strong></li>
	<li>You get good only by drawing A LOT. Make drawing a daily habit!</li>
	<li>Shy away from drawing purely from imagination at the start; ALWAYS use references!</li>
	<li>Pick ONE course or book and FINISH it. Don't switch them without a good reason!</li>
	<li>Find an art community where people aren't afraid to give you negative feedback.</li>
	<li>Broadcasted radio is good background music for drawing.</li>
	<li>Learning from great teachers might be easier and faster than from great artists.</li>
</ul>
<p>I could have written way more, cite my favorite book or artist, but honestly, for every advice, you will be able to find counter-advice from a successful or well-acclaimed artists who will claim the direct opposite. Observation and drawing a lot. That is all there is to it. Everything else is just a bonus that can hinder or speed up your progress.</p>

<h2>The BEG books</h2>
<p>The list of books i completed. They are sorted chronologically as i went through them. I have read each book from start to finish, and you can easily tell if i did all the exercises + copied the drawings or if i just flew through it simply by checking the gallery.</p>

	<ul class="book">
		<li>Bert Dodson: <a href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/18804429-keys-to-drawing"><b>Keys to Drawing</b></a>, 1985</li>
		<li><b>Observation</b>, intuition, fun.</li>
		<li>Pencil and eraser.</li>
		<li><a href="index.html?tags=~keysdraw">69 studies</a></li>
		<li><i>Draw what you see even if it feels wrong.</i></li>
		<li><strong>10/10 easily the best book for beginner</strong>. The only drawback is a somewhat steep learning curve at the start. The book covers a broad range of drawing techniques while maintaining a steady skill curve. You will mostly draw from real life or references and learn about various drawing concepts like perspective, sighting, composition, rendering, shadows or even from where you can gain inspiration.</li>

		<li><b>Observation</b>, strict instructions.</li>
		<li>Pencil, eraser, charcoal, viewfinder.</li>
		<li><a href="index.html?tags=~rightbrain">14 studies</a></li>
		<li><i>Trick your left brain hemisphere into dropping out of the task.</i></li>
		<li><strong>6/10 suitable for people persuaded they don't have a talent</strong> for drawing. Elementary book covering the minimum you need to know to draw correctly from observation. Very wordy. If you won't fall asleep while reading it, you WILL LEARN how to draw! This book has <a href="https://www.drawright.com/before-after/harrys-before-and-after-drawings-november-711-2022">undeniable results</a>. As a bonus, you will read about the failing USA education system and your own brain.</li>

		<li><b>Gesture</b>, observation, intuition, grind.</li>
		<li>Pencil, ink, charcoal, watercolors, oil.</li>
		<li><a href="index.html?tags=~naturway">93 studies</a></li>
		<li><i>Draw thousands of gestures and then draw more of them.</i></li>
		<li><strong>5/10 controversial experience imitating university art course</strong>. The book explicitly states you won't learn anything from it unless you follow through with the prescribed exercises and grind. I kid you not i improved just by the gesture grind. Around ~3000th gesture, it finally dawned on me. However, i cannot recommend this book to anyone unless they struggle with STIFF figures. Whatever this book teaches, it feels like you are doing it in the most inefficient way possible. But that could simply be just me. Anatomy, figure proportions, drapery, <b>feeling the form</b>. The book contains a lot of very interesting revelations. But the price you will pay will be MANY days of grinding gestures.</li>
