<h1>My (Art) Endeavors</h1>
<p>I'll admit it's easy to get lost in my <a href="index.html">main gallery</a>, which combines studies, doodles, and sporadic "art" pieces. Therefore, I'll list the larger, more notable projects on this website in a digestible structure:</p>

<div class=project>
	<a href="projects/cityofgodfull.jpg"><img src="projects/cityofgodthumb.jpg" title="City of God Book Cover"></a>
	<div class=desc>
		<h2>City of God: Fiat Voluntas Dei</h2>
		<p>A new horror investigation game set in the religious Dark Ages of Western Europe.</p>
		<p>My first "real" project. I was randomly contacted by anon (<a href="https://twitter.com/ink_adventures">ink_adventures</a>) who saw my posts online and told me about his vision of a roleplaying book. He introduced himself as a writer and wanted illustrator for his project. And since i had nothing to lose i accepted.</p>
		<p>The team was basically me (drawing, designing, quality assurance) and Fin (idea guy, writer, boss). There were other 3 people involved, but their contributions were so minor you might as well overlook them. The work on the project lasted roughly 4 months (with breaks) and i would call it <a href="crit/20230906.png">minor success</a>. Majority of my <a href="index.html?tags=~cityofgod">artwork here</a> was used in the final PDF document.</p>
		<p><i>"You are defined by your belief in God. Faith is a measure of how great that belief may be, and how deep it will go. In the end, only your faith will protect you."</i></p>
		<p>Find it on <a href="https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/spilledinkstudios/city-of-god-demon-investigation-ttrpg-digital-release">Kickstarter</a> or <a href="https://spilled-ink-studios.itch.io">itch.io</a>.
